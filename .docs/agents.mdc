# Agent Guidance — mayeedwin/profile

## Project Overview
Personal PWA profile page for Maye Edwin, built as a **Vite + vanilla TypeScript** project deployed to **Firebase Hosting**. No frameworks — pure TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Architecture
```
index.html          ← Vite HTML entry (root)
src/
  main.ts           ← Panel navigation logic (vanilla TS, no jQuery)
  web-share.ts      ← Web Share API integration
  style.css         ← Imports app CSS (Google Fonts, Font Awesome via CDN)
public/
  manifest.json     ← PWA web manifest
  service-worker.js ← Fetch-based caching service worker
  icons/            ← PWA icons (pwafire*.png)
  images/           ← Profile images (mayeedwingdg.jpg, pic04.jpg …)
dist/               ← Vite build output (gitignored) — Firebase Hosting serves this
```

## Critical Developer Workflows
```bash
npm install          # install deps (vite, typescript)
npm run dev          # local dev server at http://localhost:5173
npm run build        # emit production build → dist/
npm run preview      # serve dist/ locally for smoke-testing
```
Firebase deploy: `firebase deploy` — reads `"public": "dist"` from `firebase.json`.

## Key Patterns & Conventions

### Panel Navigation (src/main.ts)
Single-page feel via CSS `display` toggling + `inactive` class transitions.  
All panels live inside `#wrapper`; the first `.panel` is visible, rest start hidden.  
Anchor clicks on `a[href^="#"]` drive transitions — `locked` boolean prevents re-entrancy.  
`spinX`/`spinY` classes on `<ul>` trigger a 250ms extra delay before switching.

### Breakpoints
Responsive behaviour is handled **entirely by CSS media queries** in `src/style.css`.  
There is no JS breakpoint library (skel.js was removed during the Vite migration).

### Web Share API (src/web-share.ts)
Feature-detected with `navigator.share !== undefined`.  
The `.share` CSS class on any `<a>` element is the trigger button.

### PWA / Service Worker
Service worker is registered in `src/main.ts` on the `load` event.  
The worker itself lives in `public/service-worker.js` (served at `/service-worker.js`).  
Manifest is `public/manifest.json` — linked from `index.html` as `/manifest.json`.

### CSS
`src/style.css` contains all styles.  
External CDN fonts/icons: Google Fonts (`Raleway`, `Montserrat`) and Font Awesome 4.6 from MaxCDN — both `@import`-ed at the top of the CSS file.  
Body loading-state classes `is-loading-0` / `is-loading-1` control entry animations.

### Firebase
Project: `pwafire-codelab` (see `.firebaserc`).  
`firebase.json` sets `"public": "dist"` — always run `npm run build` before deploying.  
Firebase SDK is initialised inline in `index.html` (legacy CDN script, analytics only).
